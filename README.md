# NLP Text Analysis App Project

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Front-end nanodegree.

The goal of this project is to give you practice with:
- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Creating layouts and page design
- Service workers
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls

## Configuration
We will be using the [Aylien API](https://aylien.com/) during this project. My credentials are hidden in my local `.env` file.
If you wish to run the app you will need to [sign up](https://developer.aylien.com/signup) and ask for an API key
Once this is done, create the `.env` file and write so:
```
API_ID=yourApiID
API_KEY=yourApiKey
```

## Installation
To install all the dependencies : `npm i`

## Running
1. `npm run build-prod` to build production files
2. `npm run build-dev` to run webpack developer server
3. `npm run start` to run local node server 
4. `npm run test` to test the app
